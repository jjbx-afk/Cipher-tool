# Cipher-tool

This is one of my first-year apprenticeship projects, and my first PHP programm.

It is a command-line application that can encrypt and decrypt user input using the following cipher algorithms:

- Caesar — https://brilliant.org/wiki/caesar-cipher/
- Vigenère — https://brilliant.org/wiki/vigenere-cipher/
- Atbash — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash
- Rail Fence — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence_cipher
- Affine — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_cipher
- Morse Code — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code

*This project is still a work in progress!*
